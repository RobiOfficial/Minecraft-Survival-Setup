# Minecraft Update 1.16.5
A Minecraft: Java Edition Release
* Happy Friday! We're now releasing 1.16.5, which fixes two critical stability issues.   
We are not releasing more information about these issues at this time to protect servers that have not yet updated.

* This release is network compatible with 1.16.4 - this means you do not need to upgrade your game right away to play on an upgraded server.  
However, we highly encourage all server owners to update as soon as possible to apply the stability fixes.
 
# Setup v1.0.0 (pre-release)
This means that we are working on updating this setup to 1.16.5 as soon as possible.  
At the moment there isn't a stable version for the setup but you can download BETA versions yourself (below).
We will not make any other changes to the setup and it will be released as pre-release.  
**If you have any issues or suggestions to this setup then please let us know here:**
