# Minecraft Survival Server Setup
This setup was created for server owners who are looking for a ready-to-go Survival Server setup for Minecraft multiplayer. It is free to use and feel free to make changes as you wish. 
> If you have any problems using this setup or you would like to make suggestions then please add these to issues. This project is just a hobby project which means that I will update it whenever I feel to do so and I will support any player who uses my setup (if I have time to do so). This GitHub page will be updated if anything changes.
* Native version of this setup is **Minecraft 1.16.5**. Please don't use older versions since it just would not work.
* Setup version: **1.1**

# Reports
Players can report online and offline players (it depends on the config) with a cooldown and a minimum amount of characters. If they don't specify any reason, a GUI (chest) is opened to select one of the defaults (configurable) reasons.
